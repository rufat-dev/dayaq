ANIMATIONS & MOTION (KEEP IT SIMPLE)

GENERAL RULES
- Animations must clarify UI state changes, not decorate the UI.
- Prefer CSS transitions for simple interactions.
- Introduce JavaScript-driven animation only when CSS is insufficient.
- Animations must be subtle, fast, and consistent across the app.

DEFAULT ANIMATION MODELS
- Fade: opacity transition (150–250ms)
- Slide + fade: opacity + translate (150–250ms)
- Scale + fade: opacity + scale (used for modals/popovers)
- Layout animation: smooth height/position changes in lists
- Skeleton shimmer: CSS keyframes only

TOOLS
- Use CSS transitions for:
  - hover states
  - button feedback
  - simple open/close UI
- Use Framer Motion ONLY for:
  - route/page transitions
  - modal enter/exit
  - list item mount/unmount
  - conditional rendering animations
- Do NOT use Framer Motion for basic hover or styling effects.

CONSTRAINTS
- No custom animation frameworks.
- No complex timelines or chained animations.
- Avoid spring physics unless explicitly required.
- Avoid animations that block user interaction.

PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Animations must not affect layout stability negatively.
- Avoid animating expensive properties (width, height when possible).

CODE STYLE
- Animation logic must be colocated with UI components.
- Reusable animation patterns should be abstracted into small helpers.
- Do not mix animation logic with business logic.
